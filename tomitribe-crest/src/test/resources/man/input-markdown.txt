# General


Rsync  copies  files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the current
host (it does not support copying files between two remote hosts).

There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system: using a
remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or contacting an rsync
daemon directly via TCP.  The remote-shell transport is used whenever the source or
destination  path  contains a single colon (:) separator after a host specification.
Contacting an rsync daemon directly happens when the source or destination
path contains a  double  colon  (::) separator after a host specification, OR when
an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the "USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL
CONNECTION" section for an exception  to this latter rule).

As  a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a
destination, the files are listed in an output format similar to "ls -l".

As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote
 host,  the copy occurs locally (see also the --list-only option).

# Setup

See the file README for installation instructions.

Once  installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access via a remote shell (as well as
 some that you can access using the rsync daemon-mode protocol).  For  remote transfers,
 a modern rsync uses ssh for its communications, but it may have been configured to
use a different remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh.


You can also specify any remote shell you like, either by  using  the  -e  command
line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment variable.

Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination machines.

# usage

You  use rsync in the same way you use rcp. You must specify a source and a destination, one of which may be remote.

Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples:
